# KukiLuki Sweats

So I try to keep it short: We want sweats(*) for KukiLuki.

(*) the word 'sweats' is (I think) a made up word with which I mean hoodies and t-shirts (and other products) to make refering to them a bit easier, instead of always "hoodies and t-shirts".

***

## Context

Last year we made simple prints of the logo (single color) on hoodies/shirts, they were great but also a bit let's call it "simple".

This is a testprint I made with another printing technique

Further another artist made a peacock, which we have printed on vynil and is decorating our DJ booth.

Now while preparing for the party a few weeks ago the idea came up to print the peacock on the back of a hoodie. Now this is a great idea and we could have done so and call it a day. But we thought to have an artist (in this case you) make his own impression of the available artwork and a design for the sweats.

## KukiLuki - artistractly(*) speaking

(*) also a fantasie word as a combination of "artistically" and "abstractly" - mostly used to put a smile on your face.

Generally we like the idea of having various artist make their own impression/version of whatever it is we want to have done for KukiLuki. So I will give you a list of "wishes" and three pictures as a general idea and direction and you can feel free and do whatever you like with it. So if you think/feel a certain idea or whish just doesn't look great or is not doable, then it's totally fine. 

So we prefer "a cool looking hoodie" over "the same thing on a t-shirt again".

That said there are a few "limits" in regards to what is printable and what not.

## Further Info

- We want to print t-shirts, hoodies, "tank-tops" and something like "gym bags". 

The focus is on t-shirts and hoodies. It's up to you if you make one design for both or not.

The tank-top and gym-bag will probably just reuse the t-shirt or whatever you come up with.


#### Colors

- Last year we mostly used black and green hoodies/t-shirts, but if it's possible to also print on something bright that's great but not necessary and probably not possible without hurting the eyes (we had print on yellow which looked very nice). 


#### From the printer

So basically the only 'requirements' we have:

- the image should have at least 300 dpi
- use a transparent background
- use cmyk (neon colors are possible)
- max print width is 35cm (which is around 14inch -- not sure which scale system you use)

## The inspirational direction

Now are following three pictures, to give you a "direction" in which this could go. 

#### The Logo

It was drawn by one of the initial members and then vectorized and touched up by someone else and even though we like our logo, somehow everybody agrees that "something is missing"  - but we don't know what.

So if you look at the logo and know what is missing feel free to alter it - even if it's just as a special version for the shirts.


#### The Peacock

This is the peacock as printed on vinyl.

These are the trimmed down files of the peacock, the original image is huge 200_000 px x 200_000 px - if you need bigger versions let me know.

You can use it as is, as inspiration for your own (or not at all).


The initial version of the peacock you can find at the bottom of [our website](https://www.kukiluki.org), where I reused the peacock which was used for the flyer.




#### The Jungle

While I was asking other members about "what is missing from the logo?" I got one response which was like: 

"hmm maybe some flowers or somehing or maybe not I don't know, but a bit something around it like gaggalacka(*)".

So as a third and final image some stock image I found on google in half a minute - so please don't use it. This is purely meant as general direction - it doesn't have to be or relate with a jungle in any way.

(*) Gaggalacka is another group organising parties and festivals, who have a very nice hoodie, which we used as an example a lot. We will also use the same printer as they do.
