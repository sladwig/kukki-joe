# KukiLuki sweats

I try to keep it short: We want sweats(*) for KukiLuki.

<i>(*) the word 'sweats' is a made up word. I'm using it to refer to hoodies and t-shirts (and other products).</i>

***

## Context

We made single colour prints of the logo on hoodies/shirts last year. They were great but also a bit simple.

This is a test print on a "gym bag" made with another printing technique, which allows us to use gradients or basically any color.

Further another artist made a peacock which we have printed on vynil and is decorating our DJ booth.

Now while preparing for the party a few weeks ago the idea came up to print the peacock on the back of a hoodie. Now this is a great idea and we could have done so and call it a day. But we thought to have an artist (in this case you) make his own impression of the available artwork as a "sweat design".

## KukiLuki - artistractly(*) speaking

<i>(*) also a fantasie word as a combination of "artistically" and "abstractly" - mostly used to put a smile on your face.</i>

Generally we like the idea of having various artist make their own impression/version of whatever it is we want to have done for KukiLuki. A bit more organic.

So what follows is a list of wishes and three pictures as a general idea and direction for the design. You can do whatever you like with it. So if you think/feel a certain idea or whish just doesn't look great/makes sense or whatever, then it's totally fine to ignore it. 

We prefer "a cool looking hoodie" over "the same thing on a t-shirt again".

That said there are a few "limits" in regards to what is printable and what is not.

## Further Info

- We want to print t-shirts, hoodies, "tank-tops" and something like "gym bags". 
	
	The focus is on t-shirts and hoodies, but I also mentioned the others to give you an idea of what we want to print on.

- Cloth color: We used mostly black and green colored clothes last year. There were one or two who chose yellow and it looked surprisingly well.
	
	To keep it simple I would say to make it work for black or green clothes (choose one) and if it's easy for you to support different or also bright colored clothes then great, but yeah most people choose the same colors anyway.

- The printer uses a so called "DAG" printer (Direct-to-Garmet) which means we could also use "slight variations" without a problem.

- if you see a way, to allow "special versions" for example for julius (as a founder) or e.g. for crew/helper or artists - then great, but this is not the main focus.

- Image
	- the image should have at least 300 dpi
	- use a transparent background
	- use cmyk (neon colors are possible as far as I understood - let me know if I should find out more)
	- max print width is 35cm (which is around 14inch -- not sure which scale system you use)


## The inspirational direction

Now are following three pictures, to give you a "direction" in which this could go. 

#### The Logo

![](/kuki-logo.svg)

It was drawn by one of the initial members and then vectorized and touched up by someone else and even though we like our logo, somehow everybody agrees that "something is missing"  - but we don't know what.

If you see ways to improve the logo feel free to alter it - even if it's just for the shirts


#### The Peacock

![](/pauw.png)

This is the peacock as printed on vinyl.

These is the trimmed down file, the original image is huge 200_000 px x 200_000 px -so if you want a bigger versions let me know.

You can use it "as is", as inspiration for your own (or not at all).


On [our website](https://www.kukiluki.org) at the bottom you can find the very first peacock we used on the flyers, after that we hired an artist friend of Julius to draw the peacock to print on vinyl. 




#### The Jungle

While I was asking other members about "what is missing from the logo?" I got one response which was like: 

    "hmm maybe some flowers or somehing or maybe not I don't know, but a bit something around it like gaggalacka or maybe not(*)".

So as a third and final image some stock image I found on google in half a minute - so please don't use it. This is purely meant as general direction - the design itself does not have to have any accociation with jungle.

(*) Gaggalacka is another group organising parties and festivals, who have a very nice hoodie and we often refer to as an example a lot. - Also we will use the same printer as they do.
